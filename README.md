### Hello, I'm Olli :wave:!

I work as a cross-functional software engineer located in Germany. Developing web and desktop apps has always accompanied me. It all started in 2005 when I got my first computer and digged into exploiting online video games. For educational purposes obviously.

Since then, I've basically been a vacuum cleaner when it comes to knowledge.

**Personal**

- :man_astronaut: Enjoying and following many IT-related topics. Reddit :handshake: Me
- :keyboard: Interested in writing reliable, fast and secure software. Not afraid to use `unsafe` tho
- :family_man_woman_girl_boy: Trying to restore people's faith in software while Microsoft Teams is crashing on a daily basis

**Favorite languages, platforms and tools**
