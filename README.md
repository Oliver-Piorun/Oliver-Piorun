### Hello, I'm Oliver Piorun :wave:!

I work as a cross-functional software engineer located in Germany. Developing web and desktop apps has always accompanied me. It all began in 2005 when I got my first computer and started exploiting video games. For educational purposes ... obviously :wink:

Since then I am hungry for knowledge and I cannot see it fading away.

**Personal**
- :desktop_computer: Enjoying and following many IT-related topics
- :keyboard: Interested in writing reliable, fast and secure software
- :point_right: Trying to make people's lives easier, essentially
