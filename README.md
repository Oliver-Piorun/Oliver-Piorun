### Hello, I'm Oliver Piorun :wave:!

I work as a cross-functional software engineer located in Germany. Developing web and desktop apps has always accompanied me. It all started in 2005 when I got my first computer and digged into exploiting online video games. For educational purposes [...] obviously.

Since then I am basically a vacuum cleaner for knowledge.

**Personal**

- :desktop_computer: Enjoying and following many IT-related topics
- :keyboard: Interested in writing reliable, fast and secure software
- :point_right: Trying to make people's lives easier and more enjoyable, essentially

**Favorite languages, platforms and tools**
